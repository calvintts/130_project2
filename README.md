In order to make the website running, first you need to create a database "registration" in myphpadmin.\n
We both met up to work with the problems so it is not clear that who is in charge of which part of the website. \n
We started by writing some html pages for front end, then got mysql database setup along with the login function, then the search, sort and add item functions by making use of sql queries.
